# 🎌 Flags Game with Turtle (Python)

Welcome to the **Flags Game**, a Python-based educational and interactive game where players must guess the national flags displayed using the `turtle` graphics module.

## 🧠 About the Game

This project challenges players to identify European country flags. Flags are randomly displayed, and the player has to correctly guess the country name. The game includes a scoring system, lives, and a win/lose condition.

## 🚀 Features

- 🐢 Draws 9 different country flags using the Turtle module
- 🎲 Random flag selection every round
- ✅ Simple scoring system (+2 for correct, -2 for wrong)
- ❤️ 3 lives before game over
- 🎉 Win if you guess all flags correctly

## 📷 Flags Included

- Austria  
- Belgium  
- Estonia  
- France  
- Germany  
- Italy  
- Poland  
- Sweden  
- Greece  

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. A flag will be drawn on the screen.
3. You will be prompted:  
   `Which flag is this??`
4. Type in the country name (case-insensitive).
5. Gain or lose points based on your answer.
6. Win by guessing all flags; lose if lives drop to 0 or points to -10.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## 🧪 Running the Game

```bash
python flags_game.py
Make sure the terminal window is active to input your answers.

🔧 Future Improvements
Add more country flags

Use images for flags instead of drawing

GUI menu or flag hint system
